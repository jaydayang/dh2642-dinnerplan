// JavaScript Documentvar DinnerView = function (container, model) {		/**	 * We use the @method find() on @var {jQuery object} container to look for various elements 	 * inside the view in orther to use them later on. For instance:	 * 	 * @var {jQuery object} numberOfGuests is a reference to the <span> element that 	 * represents the placeholder for where we want to show the number of guests. It's	 * a reference to HTML element (wrapped in jQuery object for added benefit of jQuery methods)	 * and we can use it to modify <span>, for example to populate it with dynamic data (for now 	 * only 'Hello world', but you should change this by end of Lab 1).	 * 	 * We use variables when we want to make the reference private (only available within) the	 * ExampleView.	 * 	 * IMPORTANT: Never use $('someSelector') directly in the views. Always use container.find	 * or some other way of searching only among the containers child elements. In this way you	 * make your view code modular and ensure it dosn't break if by mistake somebody else	 * in some other view gives the same ID to another element.	 * 		*/		var dinneroverview = container.find("#dinneroverview");				var dishitemview = new DishitemView(container, model);		var dinnercontent = '<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">'+ dishitemview.getdinnercontentandprice()+'</div><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><h3>Total:</h3><h4>'+model.getTotalMenuPrice()+'</h4></div>';					console.log(dinnercontent);		dinneroverview.html(dinnercontent);			}
